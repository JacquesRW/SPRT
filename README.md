# SPRT

This repo contains:
- a scipt to calculate SPRT results, as per OpenBench's method
- derivation/explanations of
    - [SPRT](SPRT.md) (used by OpenBench and CuteChess)
    - [GSPRT](GSPRT.md) (of which a more developed method is used by Fishtest)

All of this is, of course, in the context of chess. Both SPRT and GSPRT are self-contained
w.r.t each other, some familiarity with what hypothesis testing does is assumed.
